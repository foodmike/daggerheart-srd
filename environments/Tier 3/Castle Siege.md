   desc: "Consequence Countdown (5). The attacking force deploys siege weapons to try to raze the defenders’ fortifications. Activate the countdown when the siege begins (for a protracted siege, make this a long-term countdown instead). When it triggers, the defenders’ fortifications have been breached and the attackers flood in. You gain 2 Fear, then shift to the Pitched Battle environment and spotlight it.\n\n  *What siege weapons are being deployed? Are they magical, mundane, or a mixture of both? What defenses must the characters overcome to storm the castle?*"

   desc: "Summon a Knight of the Realm, a number of Tier 3 Minions equal to the number of PCs, and two adversaries of your choice within Far range of a chosen PC as reinforcements.

 - name: "Collateral Damage - Reaction"

All targets within Very Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll.\n\n  - Targets who fail take 3d8+3 physical or magic damage and must mark a Stress.\n  - Targets who succeed must mark a Stress.\n\n  *What debris is scattered by the attack? What is broken by the strike that can’t be easily mended?*"
