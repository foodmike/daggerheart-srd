 - name: "Adrift on a Sea of Steel - Passive"
   desc: "Traversing a battlefield during an active combat is extremely dangerous. A PC must succeed on an Agility Roll to move at all, and can only go up to Close range on a success. If an adversary is within Melee range of them, they must mark a Stress to make an Agility Roll to move.\n\n  *Do the combatants mistake you for the enemy or consider you interlopers? Can you tell the difference between friend and foe in the fray?*"
 - name: "Raze and Pillage - Action"
   desc: "The attacking force raises the stakes by lighting a fire, stealing a valuable asset, kidnapping an important person, or killing the populace.\n\n  *What is valuable here? Who is most vulnerable?*"
 - name: "War Magic - Action"
   desc: "Spend a Fear as a mage from one side uses large-scale destructive magic. Pick a point on the battlefield within Very Far range of the mage. All targets within Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 3d12+8 magic damage and must mark a Stress.\n\n  *What form does the attack take—fireball, raining acid, a storm of blades? What tactical objective is this attack meant to accomplish, and what comes next?*"
 - name: "Reinforcements - Action"
   desc: "Summon a Knight of the Realm, a number of Tier 3 Minions equal to the number of PCs, and two adversaries of your choice within Far range of a chosen PC as reinforcements. The Knight of the Realm immediately takes the spotlight.\n\n  *Who are they targeting first? What formation do they take?*"
