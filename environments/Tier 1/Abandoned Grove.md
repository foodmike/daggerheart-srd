 - name: "Overgrown Battlefield - Passive"
   desc: "There has been a battle here. A PC can make an Instinct Roll to identify evidence of that fight. On a success with Hope, learn all three pieces of information below. On a success with Fear, learn two. On a failure, a PC can mark 3 Stress to learn one and gain advantage on the next action roll to investigate this environment. A PC with an appropriate background or Experience can learn an additional detail and ask a follow-up question about the scene and get a truthful (if not always complete) answer.\n\n  - Traces of a battle (broken weapons and branches, gouges in the ground) litter the ground.\n  - A moss-covered tree trunk is actually the corpse of a treant.\n  - Still-standing trees are twisted in strange ways, as if by powerful magic.\n\n*Why did these groups come to blows? Why is the grove unused now?*"

   desc: "Pick a point within the grove. All targets within Very Close range of that point must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 1d8+3 physical damage and become Restrained by barbed vines.

Do they pull you down or lift you off the ground?*"
 - name: "You Are Not Welcome Here - Action"
   desc: "A Young Dryad, two Sylvan Soldiers, and a number of Minor Treants equal to the number of PCs appear to confront the party for their intrusion.\n\n*What are the grove guardians concealing? What threat to the forest could the PCs confront to appease the Dryad?*"

They appear within Far range of a chosen PC and immediately take the spotlight.\n\n*What color does the grass turn as the elemental appears? How does the chaos warp insects and small wildlife within the grove?*"
